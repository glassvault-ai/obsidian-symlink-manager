# Rename Rollback Integrity

`renameSymlinkEntry` in `src/main.ts` rolls back on failure by restoring `entry.name` and calling `createSymlink(restoreParams)`, but it doesn't check whether the restore actually succeeded. If both the rename and the rollback fail, `entry.active` stays true while no symlink exists on disk — the settings UI shows an active entry that's actually broken. The rollback should check the restore result and set `entry.active = false` with a clear notice if it fails, then persist state. This is a low-probability edge case (requires two consecutive fs failures) but the state divergence it creates is hard to debug.
