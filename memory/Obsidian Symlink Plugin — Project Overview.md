An Obsidian community plugin that manages folder symlinks with CRUD operations from within Obsidian. Desktop only (requires Node.js fs module). Tech stack: TypeScript, esbuild, standard Obsidian plugin APIs. Key insight: symlinking a project's memory/ folder into the global vault expands the graph view like 'adding a second half of its brain.'
